Loot boxes are a very common game mechanic, it lets game developers distribute content to players. These loot boxes are redeemable for in-game items called loot. Loots take meaning inside the game context and can range from skins to in-game advantage. They were inspired by Asian candy toys, where a random price is revealed on opening the candy.

In very few years they have sprung in all game genres, creating a new business model paradigm, where revenue becomes a stream, instead of the single sold game, now users buy upon thoughts of dollars in-game items. This massive adoption is partly a response due to the rising development cost. They are also a great way to  promote users engagement. It's estimated that by 2022, loot-boxes will have a market of 50 billion dollars. 

Just Mint is a set of tools for game developers that aim to shorten the gap between web3 and game developers. Simplifying the expression of in-game items as NFTs. Doing so empowers gamers, making them true owners of their won items. It gives developers a new needed source of revenue. And both gain access to the metaverse. Where their items can be expressed outside the game, and be materialized in a new reality.
