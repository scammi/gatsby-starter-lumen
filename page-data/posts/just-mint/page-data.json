These loot boxes are redeemable for in-game items called loot. Loots take meaning inside the game context and can range from skins to in-game advantage. They were inspired by Gashapon, a variety of vending machine-dispensed capsule toys popular in Asia.</p>\n<p>In very few years they have sprung in all game genres, creating a new business model paradigm, where revenue becomes a stream, instead of the single sold game, now users buy upon thoughts of dollars in-game items. This massive adoption is partly a response due to the rising development cost. They are also a great way to promote users engagement. Itâ€™s estimated that by 2022, loot-boxes will have a market of 50 billion dollars.</p>\n<p>Just Mint is a set of tools for game developers that aim to shorten the gap between web3 and game developers. Simplifying the expression of in-game items as NFTs. Doing so empowers gamers, making them true owners of their won items. It gives developers a new needed source of revenue. And both gain access to the metaverse. Where their items can be expressed outside the game, and be materialized in a new reality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/just-mint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Show case</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/xJiABLuD06g?t=1824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Live demo</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/just-mint/","tagSlugs":["/tag/just-mint/","/tag/crypto/","/tag/english/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-23T23:46:37.121Z","description":"Brief introduction to just mint, ETH2021 global finalists.
