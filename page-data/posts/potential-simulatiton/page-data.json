It is meant to be a flexible software sketchbook. I choose processing since trying ideas and sharing them easy and straight forward.\nThe program works by simulating an excitable “cell” as a class, there are three main methods “membrane potential”, “depolarized” and “conduct”. Membrane potential method uses a simplified version of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation.\nMedical physiology Walter Boron</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/408/1*KvF83mRq8aLjcDNjF597jA.png\"></p>\n<p>The alpha variable in the equation is the quotient of the permeability between Na and K (PNa/Pk). The number is very low during resting potential since the permeability of K predominates. During an action potential these changes, the permeability of Na increases rapidly in a sigmoid fashion. The depolarize method generates this same change in the alpha variable producing a sudden increase in membrane voltage.\nThe first action potential is trigger through an automatic cell through a timer, it then propagates thanks to the conducted method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"array-of-cells\"><a href=\"#array-of-cells\" aria-label=\"array of cells permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Array of cells</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/480/1*bKgCyWNTup538aygSytsLg.gif\"></p>\n<p>Every square is a cell object and holds in its state the result of the GHK equation that’s calculated 30 times per second.
